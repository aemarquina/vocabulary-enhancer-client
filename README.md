## Technologies used
- Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery and Handlebars

## List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
- Some unresolved problems I had was creating a search bar in order to pick out only one word rather than having to look through them.
- I also would like to implement an accomplished table so that once a word is learned they will be able to add it to that table rather than having to remove it to see their projects.
- I would also like to incentivize learning these new words so making a game out of them and having a point system that is ranked with other users would be fun too.

## Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
I started with my user stories and started psuedocoding. I started on the front end of my application once I finished my backend. I started by working on my html, but it was a very rudimentary layout as I only wanted something to be able to test the rest of my JavaScript. I then started to work on my authentication click events and made sure that they connected to the proper path. Once that was accomplished, I used Handlebars to generate html and certain JavaScript command on click events. This was the trickiest part of the project as the certain click events were in handlebars and were not on the actual HTML page. Thankfully, with a little adjustment of the click event, I was able to get the click events to work. I was able to move swiftly through this project because I made sure that I broke the project in to smaller more palatable pieces so I would not get overwhelmed.
